		        <p class="chila fs14mobile wow fadeInDown fs20pxmainblock" style="text-align:justify">The Covid Pandemic is having an ever-lasting effect on us as all round the world. The constant lockdowns and ever increasing Covid-safe rules have literally brought the whole world to their knees with constantly asking them to be indoors and avoid social gatherings. The kids have been constantly missing their curriculum and an interaction with their core buddies is now a dream they want to live. Parents on the other hand are constantly finding it difficult to keep their kids engaged with schools shut temporarily and restrictions on outdoor activities.</p>
		        <p class="chila fs14mobile wow fadeInDown fs20pxmainblock" style="text-align:justify">To address this issue and come up with a solution, we the “Mindscape Invaders” have come up with "Tender Minds", a website catering to kids belonging to age groups “5 to 10”, to keep the little ones engaged with a variety of games and music and interactive platforms for the kids to engage with their buddies. "You have buddies / brothers at home?” No problem, as we now have multiplayer mode as well for our website. We also want kids to interact with our website as a chat-bot will be constantly talking to the kids, understanding them and recommending them some content best suited for their mood. At the end, all we want, is a smile on the kids face.</p>
		        <p class="chila fs14mobile wow fadeInDown fs20pxmainblock" style="text-align:justify">As much as we appreciate the kids to be on our website, we believe they need to rest and stretch themselves every now and then. A message on their screen would pop-up advising them to stretch a bit and also timely ask them "how they feel".</p>
		        <p class="chila fs14mobile wow fadeInDown fs20pxmainblock" style="text-align:justify">Apart from the kids, we give the parents an option to regularly monitor their kid's mental health as it can get troublesome at times for the kids to handle these lockdowns. A "Parent's Page" to understand their kid’s progress in terms of his usage and his daily well-being as well. A map with nearby health centre locations pinned on it with their contact details just in case the parents feel the need to talk to a counsellor. For any emergency situations we have the SOS feature for immediate help at your fingertips.</p>
		        <p class="chila fs14mobile wow fadeInDown fs20pxmainblock" style="text-align:justify">Hence, we bring to you an all-round website from learning to gaming to engaging to monitoring to consulting facilities to "Need Help" functions. </p>
