Tender Minds Website:

The website designed by the Team “Mindspace Invaders” is basically a platform for young Kids between the age bracket of “5 to 10” who are tired, stressed, facing anxiety and loneliness considering the ongoing lockdowns and severe curfews. This website has some interactive pages such as Games, Videos, Stories and the Chat Room page to keep the kids engaged and motivated. Apart from these pages, our website also has some key features which are mentioned below.

The key features of the website are: 
- The Chatbot feature: This feature will allow the kids to interact with the system and express their feelings by interacting with the chatbot.
This very feature will also enable us to track the kids’ feelings each day and allow the parents to have a quick inspection on their child’s performance on a timely basis in the form of an email.
- The Need Help feature: This feature will allow both children and the parents to find out the nearest mental health center based on the selection of their area or the council.
- The Login/Signup feature: This feature is developed to disable the access of the parent’s page by the children. This page can only be accessed by parents who have signed up with our system.
- The Map feature: The map feature can be found in the parent’s page where all the mental health centers across Melbourne will be displayed to the parents along with the center information such as the Name, Address and the Contact details of the health clinics.
